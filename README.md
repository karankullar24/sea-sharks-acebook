# AceBook

## Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then:

- Install the .NET Entity Framework CLI
  * `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
- Create the database/s in `psql`
  * `CREATE DATABASE acebook_csharp_development;`
  * `CREATE DATABASE acebook_csharp_test;`
- Run the migration to create the tables
  * `cd` into `/Acebook`
  * `dotnet ef database update`
  * `DATABASE_NAME=acebook_csharp_development dotnet ef database update`
- Start the application, with the development database
  * `DATABASE_NAME=acebook_csharp_development dotnet watch run`
- Go to `http://localhost:5287/`

## Running the Tests

- Install playwright package
  * `dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright`
- Install playwright browser
  * `pwsh bin/Debug/net9.0/playwright.ps1 install`
- Verify its installation
 * `dotnet list package`
- Start the application, with the default (test) database
  * `dotnet watch run`
- Open a second terminal session and run the tests
  * `dotnet test`

### Troubleshooting

If you see a popup about not being able to open Chromedriver...
- Go to **System Preferences > Security and Privacy > General**
- There should be another message about Chromedriver there
- If so, Click on **Allow Anyway**

## Updating the Database

Changes are applied to the database programatically, using files called _migrations_, which live in the `/Migrations` directory. The process is as follows...

- To update an existing table
  * For example, you might want to add a title to the `Post` model
  * In which case, you would add a new field there
- To create a new table
  * For example, you might want to add a table called Comments
  * First, create the `Comment` model
  * Then go to AcebookDbContext
  * And add this `public DbSet<Comment>? Comments { get; set; }` 
- Generate the migration file
  * `cd` into `/Acebook`
  * Decide what you wan to call the migration file
  * `AddTitleToPosts` or `CreateCommentsTable` would be good descriptive names
  * Then do `dotnet ef migrations add ` followed by the name you chose
  * E.g.  `dotnet ef migrations add AddTitleToPosts`
- Run the migration
  * `dotnet ef database update`

### Troubleshooting

#### Seeing `role "postgres" does not exist`?

Your application tries to connect to the database as a user called `postgres`, which is normally created automatically when you install PostgresQL. If the `postgres` user doesn't exist, you'll see `role "postgres" does not exist`.

To fix it, you'll need to create the `postgres` user.

Try this in your terminal...

```
; createuser -s postgres
```

If you see `command not found: createuser`, start a new `psql` session and do this...

```sql
create user postgres;
```

#### Want to Change an Existing Migration?

Don't edit the migration files after they've been applied / run. If you do that, it'll probably lead to problems. If you decide that the migration you just applied wasn't quite right for some reason, you have two options

- Create and run another migration (using the process above)

OR...

- Rollback / undo the last migration
- Then edit the migration file before re-running it

How do you rollbacl a migration? Let's assume that you have two migrations, both of which have been applied.

1. CreatePostsAndUsers
2. AddTitleToPosts

To rollback the second, you again use `dotnet ef database update` but this time adding the name of the last 'good' migration. In this case, that would be `CreatePostsAndUsers`. So the command is...

```shell
; dotnet ef database update CreatePostsAndUsers
```
# ü¶à SeaShark (Acebook)

---

## üìò Project Overview

This app allows users to sign themselves up to an aquatic ecosystem where they can post their thoughts into the tank ‚Äî where they are subject to being liked and commented on by other finned swimmers. üê†  

You can add these fun fishies as your friends and swim together in the Aquarium ‚Äî even post on each other‚Äôs walls or unfriend them if you‚Äôre swimming in a different direction.  

This application exists purely as a successful effort of the **Sea Sharks** team: teamwork, brilliant planning, and a love for tests! ‚ù§Ô∏è  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 9)**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **Razor Views (HTML + Tailwind CSS)**
- **SQLite / PostgreSQL / SQL Server** (depending on environment)
- **xUnit / NUnit / Playwright** (for testing)

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `/Controllers` | Request handling logic |
| `/Models` | Database entities and data transfer objects |
| `/Views` | Razor pages for rendering UI |
| `/wwwroot` | Static files (CSS, JS, images) |
| `/Data` | Database context and EF migrations |

---

## üß© Architecture & Design

### 2.1 Overview
SeaShark follows the **Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController (MVC)** architectural pattern using ASP.NET Core MVC.  
This separation of concerns improves **maintainability**, **testability**, and **scalability**.

- **Model** ‚Äì Represents data and business logic via EF Core models (e.g., `User`, `Post`, `Comment`).
- **View** ‚Äì Displays information through Razor `.cshtml` templates styled with Tailwind CSS & Flowbite.
- **Controller** ‚Äì Handles HTTP requests, interacts with models, and renders appropriate views.

All requests pass through controllers, which fetch or manipulate data using `AcebookDbContext` before returning a view.

### 2.2 MVC Request Flow
```
[Browser] ‚Üí [Controller] ‚Üí [Model / DbContext] ‚Üí [Controller] ‚Üí [View] ‚Üí [Browser]
```

**Example:**
- User visits `/search?SearchString=shark`
- Routed to `SearchBarController.Index()`
- Controller queries via `AcebookDbContext` filtering users, posts, and comments
- Results passed through `ViewBag`
- Razor view `/Views/SearchBar/Index.cshtml` renders HTML
- Browser displays filtered results

### 2.3 Application Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Example Files |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Model** | Defines entities, validation, and logic | `User.cs`, `Post.cs`, `Comment.cs`, `AcebookDbContext.cs` |
| **View** | Presents data using Razor and Tailwind | `_Layout.cshtml`, `Views/SearchBar/Index.cshtml` |
| **Controller** | Handles HTTP requests and responses | `UsersController.cs`, `PostsController.cs`, `SearchBarController.cs` |
| **Database Context** | Bridge between EF Core models and DB | `AcebookDbContext.cs` |

### 2.4 Design Decisions
- **Entity Framework Core:** Simplifies ORM, migrations, and LINQ querying  
- **Razor + TailwindCSS:** Lightweight, utility-first design system  
- **Session-based Authentication:** Simple and secure for prototype scale  
- **Search Filtering System:** One controller (`SearchBarController`) queries Users, Posts, and Comments using `SearchFilter`

## üéÆ Controllers

### 5.1 Overview
SeaShark‚Äôs controllers act as the bridge between user interactions and backend logic.  
Each controller manages a specific part of the system ‚Äî from user authentication and friendships to posting, commenting, and liking.  
Controllers follow the MVC pattern, ensuring a clean separation between **data (Models)**, **logic (Controllers)**, and **presentation (Views)**.

### 5.2 Controller Summary

| Controller | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **HomeController** | Handles default routes such as `/`, `/Privacy`, and `/Error`. Manages static pages and global view rendering. |
| **UsersController** | Manages user sign-up (`/signup`), profile display (`/users/{id}`), and profile updates. Handles profile picture uploads and bio edits. Uses session-based authentication. |
| **SessionsController** | Handles login (`/signin`) and logout (`/signout`) logic. Hashes passwords using SHA256 and manages session variables like `user_id` and `user_profile_picture`. |
| **PostsController** | Handles creation, deletion, and retrieval of posts. Supports wall posting on self or friends‚Äô profiles, includes like and comment data via eager loading (`Include`, `ThenInclude`). |
| **CommentsController** | Manages comment creation and association with posts. Handles comment deletion and related like relationships. |
| **LikesController** | Manages user ‚Äúlike‚Äù actions on posts and comments. Toggles like states, preventing duplicate entries and maintaining relational integrity. |
| **FriendsController** | Manages friend requests, acceptances, and removals. Implements logic to show friend lists, pending requests, and sent requests, filtered per logged-in user. |
| **SearchBarController** | Handles the `/Search` route. Accepts `SearchString` and `SearchFilter` parameters to query Users, Posts, and Comments dynamically. Returns results via `ViewBag` and Razor rendering. |
| **NotificationsController** | Manages the `/notifications` route, handling real-time and stored alerts for users. Retrieves, sends, and marks notifications as `read` using `AcebookDbContext` and SignalR for live updates. Returns data through Razor views or JSON responses. |

### 5.3 Common Design Patterns

- **Session-Based User Context:**  
  Controllers rely on session variables (`user_id`, `user_name`, `user_profile_picture`) to identify the current user securely.

- **Model Binding & Validation:**  
  Uses `[HttpPost]` and `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attributes to validate form submissions and prevent CSRF attacks.

- **Service Filters:**  
  `AuthenticationFilter` ensures protected routes like `/users/{id}` and `/users/{id}/update` can only be accessed by authenticated users.

- **LINQ with EF Core:**  
  Each controller uses `Include()`, `ThenInclude()`, and `Where()` to efficiently query relational data.

- **Redirect Flow:**  
  Successful actions (login, signup, upload) return `RedirectResult` or `RedirectToAction` to refresh data-driven views (e.g., `/posts`, `/users/{id}`).

### 5.4 Example Request Flow

**Scenario:** A user logs in and visits their friend‚Äôs profile.  

1. **Login:**  
   - `POST /signin` ‚Üí `SessionsController.Create()` validates credentials and stores session data.  
2. **Profile Access:**  
   - `GET /users/{id}` ‚Üí `UsersController.Index()` loads the requested user with posts, comments, and friendship data.  
3. **Friendship Check:**  
   - The controller queries `Friends` table for relationship status between current user and profile owner.  
4. **View Rendered:**  
   - Depending on context, Razor renders either `MyProfile.cshtml` or `OtherProfile.cshtml` with contextual ViewBag data.  

### 5.5 Security & Validation

- ‚úÖ **Password Hashing:** SHA256 implemented before storing user credentials.  
- ‚úÖ **CSRF Protection:** `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` used across all POST routes.  
- ‚úÖ **Authorization Checks:** Routes protected via session checks and `AuthenticationFilter`.  
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling:** `ErrorViewModel` and `Error()` methods standardised for global exception handling.
